# International Debt Default Projection  

## Overview  

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a country defaulting on its external international loans, particularly those from the World Bank and IMF. Unlike conventional models that primarily rely on financial indicators, our approach integrates historical debt data as a time series alongside various socio-economic factors. This comprehensive analysis provides a more holistic view of a country's ability to meet its debt obligations.  

## Objectives  

- **Predict debt default risk:** Estimate the probability of a country defaulting on its external loans.  
- **Identify key risk factors:** Uncover economic and social conditions that contribute to financial instability.  
- **Support policy decisions:** Provide insights for government institutions and policymakers to guide responsible borrowing and debt management.
